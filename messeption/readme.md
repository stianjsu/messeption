# Description of the app /project

## Messeption
Messeption is an app that takes inspiration from messaging apps and forums. 
These are our inspirational sources: Facebook messenger, Jodel, Twitter.

The purpose of the app is to allow users to communicate with other people via text. The most basic functionality is to post text-posts like you would on a forum. 
Later in the development process we would like to implement the ability to comment on the post and start 'threads'. These 'threads' will be a chain of replies to the original post or to other replies.
Additionally we would like to give users the ability to like/dislike posts.

## images

These images are early prototypes and drawings of how we want the app to look.


#### Front Page

Here you will be able to see a lot of posts.

We want to create a possibility to filter the post.
For instance:
- new posts first
- old posts first
- filter by user
- filter by category
