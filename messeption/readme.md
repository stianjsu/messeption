# Description of the app /project

## Messeption
Messeption is an app that takes inspiration from messaging apps and forums. 
These are our inspirational sources: Facebook messenger, Jodel, Twitter.

The purpose of the app is to allow users to communicate with other people via text. The most basic functionality is to post text-posts like you would on a forum. 
Later in the development process we would like to implement the ability to comment on the post and start 'threads'. These 'threads' will be a chain of replies to the original post or to other replies.
Additionally we would like to give users the ability to like/dislike posts.
